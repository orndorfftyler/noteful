# Noteful

This app uses GET and POST API requests to enable the user to make/delete notes and organize them into different folders.

There is a main view which displays all the notes and folders, a folder view that displays all the notes in a given folder, and a note view which displays individual notes. There are also screens for adding folders and adding notes.

This project taught me about React Router, context in React, error boundaries, real time form validation, and setting up expected prop types for React components.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Router.
